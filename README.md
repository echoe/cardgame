A card game made for Godot Game Jam #82:

Using the initial walkthrough here:

and expanding on it with some other ideas I have.

Current plan is to have a sort of 'Fights in Tight Spaces'-alike but with a Style Meter, like in Devil May Cry, that rates you based on how stylish your fighting is. But YMMV, this is my second time touching Godot and I was not coding last time! Haha. It's a process.

*END-OF-JAM UPDATE*
I had a lot of interesting plans but was probably going to go for the simplest one to code (using attack and defense as analogues for a very simple counting game), but then I found out that te game jam, instead of ending at 3pm Monday, ended at 3PM Sunday, in the middle of multiple things I was doing on said weekend.

At some point I will see if I can convert this into a working game, maybe right before the prior gamejam, but we will see :)
