A card game made for Godot Game Jam #82:

Using the initial walkthrough here:

and expanding on it with some other ideas I have.

Current plan is to have a sort of 'Fights in Tight Spaces'-alike but with a Style Meter, like in Devil May Cry, that rates you based on how stylish your fighting is. But YMMV, this is my second time touching Godot and I was not coding last time! Haha. It's a process.
